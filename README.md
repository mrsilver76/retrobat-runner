# RetroBat-Runner
*Automatically launch RetroBat when a specific button combination is pressed on any connected controller*

This simple script runs in the system tray and automatically launches RetroBat when a specific button combination is pressed. This is useful for people who don't want to run RetroBat perminantly on a computer and want an easy way to start it when they are sitting on the sofa and/or don't have easy access to a keyboard and mouse.

The script is heavily documented and can be easily modified to suit your preferences. That said, the default settings should be more than enough for most people and comes pre-compiled and working out of the box.
